% Sketch Client file format (.hsc) %
% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ %

% Every line starting with a '%' is a comment.
% Comments are single line only.

% A Sketch file is a series of comma-separated elements with
% 0 or more modifiers following each element. The final
% element is terminated with a semicolon.

% The following are valid sketch file structures.
% ;
% Elem ;
% Elem Mod ;
% Elem , Elem , Elem ;
% Elem , Elem Mod Mod , Elem ;

% Each element and modifier is preceded by a type.
% The element data is surrounded by a type of matching brackets,
% (including empty data).

% Flattened data is encoded as base-36 triples (tick marks optional)
% Negative values are allowed, and enocded like so:
% (000, hzz) -> (+0, +23327)
% (i00, zzz) -> (-23328, -1)
%         (x,y)---(x,y)---(x,y)   (x,y)--- etc...

% % Raw ".sketch" data can be converted into flattened data:
% Raw [ 0000m800m8go00go0000 ],

% Brush data is encoded by alternating stroke diamaters
% and strokes. The stroke diameters are 2 digit base-36
% integers, and the stroke points are 8 base-36 digits each.
% (The last two denote that point's pressure.)
% (00, zz) -> (0.0, 1.0)

%         dd xxxyyy pp xxxyyy pp etc...
